\noindent
By Milestone~2, we delivered a functional prototype of the real-time traffic simulation application. The system can connect to a live SUMO simulation via TraCI, run or step the simulation, and visualize the network and moving vehicles directly in the JavaFX GUI. Core interactive features—vehicle injection and manual traffic light control—are implemented, enabling users to actively influence traffic flow during runtime.

\noindent
The main challenges identified at this stage are performance and update-frequency trade-offs when handling large vehicle counts, particularly during stress testing. These findings guide the next development steps: improving rendering efficiency, reducing unnecessary UI refresh work, and extending the control logic (e.g., more advanced traffic light strategies and richer analytics). Overall, Milestone~2 establishes a solid, end-to-end pipeline from SUMO to a responsive GUI with tangible control capabilities.
