\noindent
In the first milestone, we successfully designed the complete graphical user interface of the application using JavaFX and Scene Builder. The GUI now provides all required structural components, including the simulation toolbar, configuration tabs, map display area, metrics panel, and status bar.

\noindent
Although SUMO backend integration is not yet implemented, the interface is fully organized, responsive, and ready for the functional features that will be added in future milestones. The work completed here forms the foundation for real-time simulation control and visualization in the next development stages.
