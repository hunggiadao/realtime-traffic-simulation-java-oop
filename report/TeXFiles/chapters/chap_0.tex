\noindent
This project develops a real-time traffic simulation application using Java, JavaFX, and the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO). The goal is to provide an interactive desktop GUI that connects to a running SUMO simulation via TraCI (TraaS) and enables users to visualize and control key traffic elements.
\medskip

\noindent
By Milestone~2, the project has reached a functional prototype stage. The application can establish a live SUMO connection, advance the simulation in real time (or step-by-step), and render the SUMO network directly inside the JavaFX GUI with moving vehicles. It also supports interactive vehicle injection (selecting a target edge, number of vehicles, speed, and color) and manual traffic light control (switching phases and adjusting phase duration). For usability and debugging, the GUI includes live status indicators, a vehicle table and chart, and optional filters (e.g., by vehicle color, speed, and congestion heuristics).

\noindent
In addition to the working application, the Milestone~2 deliverables include inline code documentation (Javadoc), a draft user guide, and a stress-test scenario (\texttt{Stress.sumocfg}) to evaluate performance with a large number of vehicles. The report summarizes implemented features, current limitations, and the main challenges discovered during stress testing.
