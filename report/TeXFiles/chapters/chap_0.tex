\noindent
This project is the development of a real-time traffic simulation application using Java and other support tools, such as JavaFX and the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) traffic simulator. During Milestone 1, the primary objective was to design the graphical user interface that will serve as the foundation for future simulation control and visualization. 
\medskip

\noindent
The interface was created using JavaFX and Scene Builder, following a structured layout to support key features such as simulation configuration, vehicle and traffic light management, map visualization, and performance metrics. Although backend SUMO integration is not yet implemented, the completed UI provides a clear, organized, and fully resizable framework that prepares the application for the technical functionality planned in later milestones.
