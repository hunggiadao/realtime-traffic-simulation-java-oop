\section{Graphical User Interface (GUI)}

\noindent
For Milestone~1, we designed the graphical user interface of the application using JavaFX and Scene Builder. In Milestone~2, we extended this UI into a functional prototype by integrating a live SUMO connection, real-time stepping, map rendering, vehicle injection, and traffic light control.
\medskip

\noindent
The interface is built around a \texttt{BorderPane} layout, dividing the window into clear functional regions. At the top of the application, a responsive toolbar provides the essential simulation controls, including opening a SUMO configuration file, connecting to the simulation backend, starting or pausing the simulation, executing single simulation steps, and adjusting the simulation speed. This layout remains clean and stable when the window is resized.
\medskip

    \label{fig:milestone2-ui}
\end{figure}

\noindent
On the left side, a \texttt{TabPane} organizes settings into tabs such as \textit{Simulation}, \textit{Vehicles} (injection), \textit{Traffic Lights}, and \textit{Filters}. The Simulation tab supports selecting a \texttt{.sumocfg} file and adjusting the step interval, while the Vehicles tab provides controls for injecting vehicles into a selected edge.
\medskip

\noindent
The central region contains the map view. In Milestone~2, this region renders the SUMO network (parsed from the network file referenced by the loaded \texttt{.sumocfg}) and draws moving vehicles based on TraCI position updates. The map supports zooming and panning to inspect local behavior around intersections.
\medskip

\noindent
On the right side, a second \texttt{TabPane} provides simulation metrics. The \textit{Vehicle Table} tab contains a JavaFX \texttt{TableView} that is populated with live data (vehicle ID, speed, and current edge). A simple line chart tracks vehicle count over time.
\medskip

\noindent
Finally, a status bar at the bottom displays key runtime information such as simulation step, simulation time, vehicle count, and connection status.
\medskip

\noindent
Overall, the UI now provides a complete workflow for Milestone~2: load a scenario, connect to SUMO, run or step the simulation, visualize the network with moving vehicles, inject vehicles interactively, and manipulate traffic light phases.

\section{Milestone 2: Core Functionalities}

\subsection{Live SUMO Connection and Simulation Control}

\noindent
The application establishes a TraCI connection to SUMO and manages the simulation lifecycle (connect, disconnect, step, and run/pause). The simulation can run continuously with a configurable step length, and the GUI reflects the current state through a status bar (step number, simulation time, and vehicle count).
\medskip

\subsection{Map Visualization in the Application}

\noindent
The map renderer parses the SUMO network file (\texttt{.net.xml}) to extract lane polylines and junction shapes. During runtime, the renderer updates vehicle positions from TraCI and draws moving vehicles on top of the network. To improve interpretability at intersections, the map overlays traffic-light stop lines colored by the current signal state (red/yellow/green).
\medskip

\noindent

\medskip

\subsection{Vehicle Injection}

\noindent
Users can inject vehicles during a running simulation by selecting a target edge and specifying the number of vehicles, an optional speed, and a color. Injected vehicles are immediately reflected in the map rendering and vehicle table, enabling quick scenario exploration and load testing.
\medskip

    \label{fig:stress-inject}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Traffic Light Control}

\noindent
The Traffic Lights tab provides direct control over signal behavior. Users can select a traffic light ID, switch to the previous/next phase, and adjust the current phase duration. This enables interactive experimentation with signal timings and their impact on traffic flow.
\medskip

\medskip

\subsection{Filtering and Diagnostics}

\noindent
To support debugging and analysis, the GUI provides optional vehicle filters based on (1) vehicle color, (2) speed threshold, and (3) a congestion heuristic (edge mean speed and/or vehicle speed). The vehicle table displays the filtered set, and a chart plots vehicle count over time.
\medskip

\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Stress Test Scenario and Results}

\noindent
To validate the prototype under load, we prepared a stress-test scenario (\texttt{Stress.sumocfg}) that generates a high number of vehicles to stress vehicle injection, filtering, and rendering performance. This scenario was used to identify CPU-intensive parts of the update loop (map redraw and table refresh) and to motivate throttling strategies (e.g., updating the table less frequently or increasing the simulation step length).
\medskip

    \label{fig:stress-overview}
\end{figure}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Code Documentation and User Guide}

\noindent
Core components are documented using Javadoc and targeted inline comments, focusing on public APIs and non-trivial logic (e.g., TraCI connection lifecycle, map rendering, and vehicle state caching). A draft user guide (\texttt{userguide.md}) describes environment setup, launching the application, and the main UI workflows.
\medskip

%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Class Diagram Overview}

\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:classdiagram} shows the simplified class structure implemented for Milestone~1. 
The architecture is intentionally minimal, as the purpose of this stage is to establish clear responsibilities before full SUMO integration is added.
\medskip

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{../assets/class_diagram.png}
    \caption{Class diagram used in Milestone~1.}
    \label{fig:classdiagram}
\end{figure}

\noindent
The \texttt{TraCIConnector} class forms the core of the system, responsible for establishing a connection to SUMO, tracking the simulation step, and providing basic operations such as \texttt{connect()}, \texttt{step()}, and obtaining simple vehicle counts. The \texttt{VehicleWrapper} and \texttt{TrafficLightWrapper} classes each hold a reference to this connector and serve as early abstractions for accessing SUMO vehicle data and traffic light information. The \texttt{Main} class simply launches the application. This structure creates a clean separation of concerns and prepares the system for more advanced TraCI functions in future milestones.
\medskip

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Traffic Network Preparation}

\noindent
To test the SUMO setup during Milestone~1, we constructed a small traffic network based on a real street layout in Frankfurt. 
The area was selected for its moderate size and clear road geometry, making it ideal for early simulation testing. 
Figure~\ref{fig:mapreference} shows the reference map used during the process.
\medskip

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{../assets/map_sample.png}
    \caption{Reference street layout used for building the SUMO network.}
    \label{fig:mapreference}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Using SUMO's NETEDIT tool, the roads, intersections, and lane connections were recreated manually. 
This allowed the team to produce a valid \texttt{.net.xml} file that could be loaded into SUMO for simulation.
\medskip

%%%%%%%%%
\section{SUMO Network and Initial Simulation Test}

\noindent
Once the road geometry was created in NETEDIT, the network was paired with a basic route file and loaded into SUMO for testing. 
Figure~\ref{fig:sumosimulation} shows the SUMO GUI rendering of the test network.
\medskip

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{SUMO network used for the initial simulation test.}
    \label{fig:sumosimulation}
\end{figure}

\noindent
This simulation confirmed that lane connections, turning paths, and traffic flow behaved as expected. 
The successful run ensured that the SUMO environment, map setup, and route files were correctly prepared for Java integration in later phases.
\medskip

\section{TraCI Connection Test}

\noindent
During Milestone~1, we performed a small integration test to verify that a Java application could successfully communicate with SUMO via TraCI. 
\medskip

\noindent
The connector established a SUMO process, stepped the simulation once, and retrieved a simple vehicle count, confirming a working communication pipeline. Figure~\ref{fig:tracitest} illustrates the demo used during testing.
\medskip

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering

    \caption{Demo of the Java--SUMO TraCI connection during Milestone~1.}
    \label{fig:tracitest}
\end{figure}

\noindent
This confirms that the communication layer works and can be expanded with more detailed functions in the next milestones.
\medskip

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Use Case Diagram}

\noindent
Figure~\ref{fig:usecasediagram} presents the simplified use case diagram created for Milestone~1.
\medskip

\noindent
Since the full system logic is not yet implemented, the current use cases focus on core interactions: running the SUMO simulation, stepping the simulation manually, obtaining simple vehicle counts, and displaying results either in the GUI or console.
\medskip

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \caption{Use case diagram for the early-stage traffic simulation application.}
    \label{fig:usecasediagram}
\end{figure}

\noindent
These use cases provide a clear overview of what functionality is available at this stage and what interactions will be expanded in Milestone~2.
